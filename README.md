# Snake, Water, Gun Game

This is a simple Python implementation of the "Snake, Water, Gun" game, inspired by the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. The player competes against the computer (bot), where the bot randomly selects an option, and the player must choose between Snake, Water, or Gun.

## Game Rules

- **Snake (1)** beats **Water (2)**
- **Water (2)** beats **Gun (3)**
- **Gun (3)** beats **Snake (1)**
- If both the player and bot choose the same option, the result is a draw.

## How to Play

1. You will be prompted to choose between:
   - Snake (1)
   - Water (2)
   - Gun (3)
   
2. The bot will then randomly choose one of the options.
   
3. The winner of the round is determined based on the rules. If there's no winner, the game will declare a draw.

## Installation

This is a simple Python script and doesn't require any complex installation steps. You only need to have Python installed on your machine.

To check if Python is installed, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
python --version
